<h1>Replicator Dynamics</h1><h2>CREDITS</h2><p>Scott Langevin </p><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2><p>A visualization of the dynamics of a populations of agents using replicator dynamics. The players are of one of three types, each type playing a pure strategy in a 3x3 game. The user can change the payoffs of the game (but this still needs some work, we also need to add arrow that show direction. You interested?). The results are displayes in a simplex plot where each corner corresponds to one of the strategies. Dark areas correspond to fast movement of the population while lite areas represent slow movement.</p><h2>CHANGES</h2><p>20100623</p>

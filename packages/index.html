<h1>Reciprocity in Package Delivery</h1><h2>CREDITS</h2><p>Jose M Vidal </p><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2><p>In the package delivery problem a the agents must deliver a set of packages from a central depot. The destinations lie along one of several spokes emaniting from the central depot. The agents can exchange packages only at the depot. The cost to an agent is proportional to the number of packages carried.</p><p>The optimal solution to this problem is to choose one agent to go on each spoke and deliver all the packages scheduled for it. However, this would require completely selfless agents. In this program we study the dynamics that emerege when using different populations of selfish, philantropic, reciprocal, and individual agents behave. </p><p>These results were first presented in</p>

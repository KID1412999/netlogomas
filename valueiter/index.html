<h1>Value Iteration</h1><h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2><p>A demonstration of the value iteration algorithm as applied to a 2D world where a robot can move North, South, East, or West.</p><h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2><p>We build a graph where the _node_s represent the state of the underlying MDP and the directed <em>links</em> represent actions that can be taken on each state. Each link has a <em>transitions</em> variable which holds the set of <em>nodes</em> that can be reached when taken that action, along with the probabilities.</p><p>The thickness of each edge/action is proportional to its current utility.</p><p><em>prob-action-works</em> is the probability that the action (North, South, East, West) will actually take the robot to that square. With 1 - <em>prob-action-works</em> the robot will end up either at its current spot or at one of the other reachable nodes that is a distance of &lt; 2 from the intended destination, with equal probability.</p><p>The plot shows the maximum change in utility over all nodes. As expected, this value decreases monotonically.</p><h2>HOW TO USE IT</h2><p>Setup and Go.</p><h2>CREDITS AND REFERENCES</h2><p>Jose M Vidal</p><h2>CHANGES</h2><p>20110514</p><p>Initial revision</p>
